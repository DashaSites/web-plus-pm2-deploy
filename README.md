### Production deployment for a photo-sharing app (Node.js backend + frontend)

This training project was focused on learning how to deploy a full-stack web app to a remote server using PM2 and secure it with HTTPS.
As part of the task, I:
- Set up a cloud server and configured a production environment
- Deployed both frontend and backend using PM2
- Set up .env files and PM2 deployment scripts
- Configured HTTPS with free SSL certificates
- Connected a custom domain to the server

The deployed app is no longer available â€” the domain and hosting were temporary, as this was a learning assignment.

#### Technologies:
- Node.js + Express backend (API)
- React frontend
- PM2 for deployment
- Nginx as reverse proxy
- SSL (Let's Encrypt)
- Ubuntu server
